AMBER:
  ParmEd (copy to lib/python2.7/site-packages):

  tleap: include older force fields via -I

  parmchk2: 64bit may crash on some systems (Ubuntu only?) ->
    possible solution: add the following lines to PARMCHK.DAT
===== START =====
#
PARM    du      0               0       1.00    0
#
PARM    zz      0               0       1.00    0
===== END =====


Sire/Python2:
  modify Sire/Config/__init__.py to setup paths based on FES_HOME


RDKit:
  check if paths have to be set in lib/python2.7/site-packages/rdkit/RDPaths.py
  (point RDCodeDir and _share to $FES_HOME)


Openbabel:
  remove writing of residue name in WriteMolecule() in src/formats/mol2format.cpp, ~line #591: option 'r'
  allow reading of AMBER atomtypes and convert to element name in ~l179: option 'a'


OpenMM 6.2.0:
  In addition to libOpenMM.so also copy libOpenMMDrude.so, otherwise segfault
